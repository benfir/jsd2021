=== What is it?

extends kubectl with extra functionality but still feels like kubectl

=== Why?

[%step]
* development outside Kubernetes release cycle
* language agnostic
* great user experience

=== Example

[source]
----
$ kubectl have fun
$ kubectl plugins are awesome! And we can write our own ;-)
----

=== What happens behind the Scene?

[%step]
* kubectl makes an **execve** system call
* replaces the kubectl with the plugin process
* plugin process will inherit
[%step]
** the environment variables and
** the standard streams

=== Recipe

Create our first plugin in four simple step 

=== Step1

* create a file named "kubectl-have"

[%source,bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo "kubectl plugins are awesome! And we can write our own ;-)"
----

=== Step2

* make it executable

[source,shell]
----
$ chmod +x ./kubectl-have
----

=== Step3

* put it your path

[source,shell]
----
$ cp ./kubectl-have $HOME/bin
----

=== Step4

* run it

[source,shell]
----
$ kubectl have fun
kubectl plugins are awesome! And we can write our own ;-)
----

=== Rules

* naming is important
* canâ€™t overwrite existing kubectl commands
